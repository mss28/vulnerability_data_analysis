# Github vulnerability data collector

Run this project via docker using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
Also an excellent tutorial on understanding docker compose can be found [here](https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/docker-compose)

###### Example:
open a terminal inside the repository then just run
1. `docker-compose up`.
This will start *2* containers, one will run the apps and the other will host the redis storage.
2. `docker ps` to see the running containers.
3. `docker exec -it github-commit-crawler_app_1 bash` where `github-commit-crawler_app_1` is the name of the container which can be different in another machine, so make sure the 
name is correct using the `docker ps` command.
4. Once inside the container, `cd src`
5. Make sure Tor service is running using `service tor status` if not running then run `service tor start`
6. To run the python files: `python3 name_of_file.py`

## app/src/crawl_advisories.py
This will crawl reported vulnerable libraries from the [GitHub Advisory database](https://github.com/advisories) and write those to files (csv & json),
we are writing to json because it more convenient to load back and use further but we will need the csv for data analysis.
## app/src/data_collector.py
This will read back collected vulnerable libraries and use [GitHub's code search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-code) to search the whole GitHub
for any usage of the libraries. It will write back the information to csv files. The code search API has a few limitations.
1. We only get 1000 matching results.
2. API is very simple so no advanced searching can be done.

## Data collection
Data are collected in text files and redis. The text files contain:
1. data/npm_advisories (csv & json) both contain reported advisories from [GitHub Advisory database](https://github.com/advisories).
2. data/vulnerabilities.csv contain usage of the libraries found in the advisory database, they may or may not use vulnerable version of the library.

## IP masking
We have used [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) to maks IP, read more about the process [here](https://gist.github.com/DusanMadar/8d11026b7ce0bce6a67f7dd87b999f6b).
